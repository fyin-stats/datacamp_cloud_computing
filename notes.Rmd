## Cloud Computing

### Chapter 1


#### The importance of the cloud


#### Cloud computing growing further
266.4 billion dollars in 2020, projected to 354.6 billion dollars. 

#### Cloud computing definition
Cloud computing is the delivery of technology services - including compute, storage, databases, networking, software, and many more - over the internet with pay-as-you-go pricing. 

Use case - hosting a website. Users learn on DataCamp. Free week increases traffic. Hosting a website using an on-premise server. 

Server - powerful computer; you can connect to remotely; Located on the premises.

Hosting a website using an on-premise server. More people start using the website. Buy/rent new servers. Take time to set up. Cost a lot of money.

Hosting a website using a cloud server. Access to computing power instantly when you need it. More people start using the website, easily release redundant cloud servers. Pay-as-you go service. 

Cloud - Scalable, fast set-up speed, Pay-as-you-go.

On-premise - Less scalable, takes to set up, ongoing costs. 

#### Other uses of cloud computing

Store, back up and recover data.
Create cloud-native applications.
Stream audio and video.
Deliver software on demand.
Analyze data. 

#### Cloud services
three top technology services on the Cloud. compute, storage, databases. 
Compute, provide the brains to process your workload.
Storage: save and store the data.
Databases: store more structured sets of data.

##### Virtualization

Physical server: multiple virtual servers. 
Maximizes the output of individual servers.
Economies of scale.

##### Scalability 
Handling traffic. 
Vertical scaling: Increase the power of the instance. 
Horizontal scaling: Add ore instances.

##### Cost
Only pay for resources when you are using them. No capital expenses of: buying hardware and software, managing on-site infrastructure. In some cases, an on-premise solution might be more cost-efficient. The best solution depends on the use case. 


##### Speed
Immediate access to ready-to-go cloud services. 


##### Performance 
Access to fast and efficient computing resources. Data center: houses an organization's IT operations and equipment. 

Cloud gives access to worldwide network of data centers, fast and efficient computing hardware. 

##### Growth
Grow using a wide range of resources and services

##### Reliability
Guaranteed durability and availability of data and services. 

##### Security
Secure storage and management of your data. External party responsible for security. Particularly risky for business in highly regulated sectors. Cloud is becoming more and more secure. 


#### Cloud service models
On-premise: buying a car. 
Cloud: Renting a car. economies at scale.

On premise -- car owned.

Infrastructure as a service -- car rented.

Platform as a service -- ride sharing.

Software as a service -- public transport. 

abstraction and control (the cloud pyramid). Function as a service, variation of Saas. Anything as a service.


### Chapter 2 - Cloud deployment model
Important decision in cloud adoption. How much control do you need over your cloud environment?

#### Private
Cloud infra is designated for exclusive use by its tenants. Private clouds are accessed by a network link.

Pros: Direct control of resources and data, e.g., operating systems.

Cons: More upfront investment. 

Unlike on-premise, private cloud uses virtualization for on-demand compute resources and can be off-premises.

#### Public
Cloud infra is shared and open for use by the general public. It's owned and managed by a cloud service provider. Public clouds are internet accessible. 

Pros: Get started quickly with minimal investment. Easier to scale.

Cons: No access to data center and hardware.

#### Hybrid
Organization uses a combination of two or more distinct models. Different models interact via links. Example: application on public, customer data stored on private. when private cloud hits capacity, temporarily move to the public cloud to avoid disruption of service. 

#### Other deployment models
Multicloud: combination of different cloud provider services. Flexibility on pricingt plans and service offerings.

#### Community
Infra shared by a specific community for exclusive use. Common interest of concern, e.g., security, jurisdication, mission.

#### Regulations on the cloud
Having servers around the globe can reduce the latency. The greater the distance between two points, the longer it will take for data to get there. 

An example of data privacy law: General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), regulates how personal data is collected, processed, and stored from users in the European Union. 

Examples: Users must explicitly consent to data collection. Nofity users of any data breaches. Personal data information must be encrypted, anonymized, and/or pseudonymized. Personal data can't leave EU borders, unless you can guarantee the same level of protection.

What is personal data? Any information that related to an identified of identifiable living individual. Different pieces of information, which collected together can lead to identification of a particular person. 

Personally identifiable information (PII). 

Other regulations. 


#### Cloud roles
Cloud adoption can reduce maintenance and operational costs, including personnel. Cloud-related skills in job market. Cloud computing skills. All Cloud providers have established certifications for roles. 

Familiar data roles and the cloud -

\begin{itemize}
\item Data Scientist: Run computationally expensive analyses on the cloud.
\item Machine Learning Scientist: train and deploy ML models on the cloud.
\item Data engineer: Build pipelines on the cloud to ingest, transform, and store big data.
\item Data analyst: Access data on the cloud via business intelligence tools.
\end{itemize}

Creation of new roles -
\begin{itemize}
\item Cloud architect: Design cloud infra for a given business problem.
\item Cloud engineer: Build, maintain and monitor cloud services.
\item DevOps engineer: Software development and IT Operations. Ensure reliability, availability and scalability of the cloud through software development and automation.
\item Security engineer: Spec security requirements. 
\end{itemize}

### Chapter 3: Case study

#### Amazon Web Services
AWS: Q4 2019 market share: 32.4\%, revenue: 9.8 Billion, annual growth: 33.2\%. currently the market leader.
Personal cloud: Amazon drive, Amazon photos.
Professional Cloud: AWS S3 (File Storage), AWS EC2 (Computation), AWS RDS (Databases).

AWS data services: Redshift (analytics - datawarehousing); Kineses (real time data movement and analytics); SageMaker (predictive analytics and machine learning).

AWS 2006, Google Cloud 2008, MSFT Azure 2010. 

AWS case study, compay: NerdWallet, Problem: Takes too long to deploy machine learning models. Solution: Amazon Sagemaker. NerdWallet, modernized data science engineering. 

#### Microsoft Azure
Personal cloud: OneDrive

Professional Cloud: Azure Blob Storage (File Storage), Computation (Azure Virtual Machines), Databases (Azure SQL Database).

Azure's data services: Data Lake Storage (store data before cleaning); Stream analytics (real-time analytics); Machine Learning (train and deploy machine learning models).

Azure's strength: Integration with Microsoft products, benefits from customer loyalty, top-of-mind choice.

Google Cloud's strength: Multicloud. Run hybrid multicloud solutions: manage and deploy across several cloud providers.

Google Cloud case study: LUSH (only vegetarian)

Needs: outages during heavy traffic on boxing day. 

Solution: Migrate entire global infra to Google Cloud. Google Cloud Compute Engine and SQL. 40\% reduction in hosting costs. 


#### Other actors and thoughts
Alibaba Cloud (5.4\%), revenue: 1.6 billion dollars, annual growth: 71.1\%. No personal file storage. 

IBM (1.8\%), revenue: 530 million dollars. 

Oracle (smaller). 

Cloud competition is fierce. SaaS tells a different story. Best provider is the one meeting your needs. Cost of running a data center, physical hardware, storage; cost of applications; costs of hiring; benefits. 

Future of the cloud: Growing amount of data. AI needs computing resources. Smart cities need an underlying infrastructure. Serverless architectures are more and more popular.
