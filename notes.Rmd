## Cloud Computing

### Chapter 1


#### The importance of the cloud


#### Cloud computing growing further
266.4 billion dollars in 2020, projected to 354.6 billion dollars. 

#### Cloud computing definition
Cloud computing is the delivery of technology services - including compute, storage, databases, networking, software, and many more - over the internet with pay-as-you-go pricing. 

Use case - hosting a website. Users learn on DataCamp. Free week increases traffic. Hosting a website using an on-premise server. 

Server - powerful computer; you can connect to remotely; Located on the premises.

Hosting a website using an on-premise server. More people start using the website. Buy/rent new servers. Take time to set up. Cost a lot of money.

Hosting a website using a cloud server. Access to computing power instantly when you need it. More people start using the website, easily release redundant cloud servers. Pay-as-you go service. 

Cloud - Scalable, fast set-up speed, Pay-as-you-go.

On-premise - Less scalable, takes to set up, ongoing costs. 

#### Other uses of cloud computing

Store, back up and recover data.
Create cloud-native applications.
Stream audio and video.
Deliver software on demand.
Analyze data. 

#### Cloud services
three top technology services on the Cloud. compute, storage, databases. 
Compute, provide the brains to process your workload.
Storage: save and store the data.
Databases: store more structured sets of data.

##### Virtualization

Physical server: multiple virtual servers. 
Maximizes the output of individual servers.
Economies of scale.

##### Scalability 
Handling traffic. 
Vertical scaling: Increase the power of the instance. 
Horizontal scaling: Add ore instances.

##### Cost
Only pay for resources when you are using them. No capital expenses of: buying hardware and software, managing on-site infrastructure. In some cases, an on-premise solution might be more cost-efficient. The best solution depends on the use case. 


##### Speed
Immediate access to ready-to-go cloud services. 


##### Performance 
Access to fast and efficient computing resources. Data center: houses an organization's IT operations and equipment. 

Cloud gives access to worldwide network of data centers, fast and efficient computing hardware. 

##### Growth
Grow using a wide range of resources and services

##### Reliability
Guaranteed durability and availability of data and services. 

##### Security
Secure storage and management of your data. External party responsible for security. Particularly risky for business in highly regulated sectors. Cloud is becoming more and more secure. 


#### Cloud service models
On-premise: buying a car. 
Cloud: Renting a car. economies at scale.

On premise -- car owned.

Infrastructure as a service -- car rented.

Platform as a service -- ride sharing.

Software as a service -- public transport. 

abstraction and control (the cloud pyramid). Function as a service, variation of Saas. Anything as a service.

<!-- When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this: -->

<!-- ```{r cars} -->
<!-- summary(cars) -->
<!-- ``` -->

<!-- ## Including Plots -->

<!-- You can also embed plots, for example: -->

<!-- ```{r pressure, echo=FALSE} -->
<!-- plot(pressure) -->
<!-- ``` -->

<!-- Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot. -->
