266.4 billion dollars in 2020, projected to 354.6 billion dollars.

\hypertarget{cloud-computing-definition}{%
\paragraph{Cloud computing
definition}\label{cloud-computing-definition}}

Cloud computing is the delivery of technology services - including
compute, storage, databases, networking, software, and many more - over
the internet with pay-as-you-go pricing.

Use case - hosting a website. Users learn on DataCamp. Free week
increases traffic. Hosting a website using an on-premise server.

Server - powerful computer; you can connect to remotely; Located on the
premises.

Hosting a website using an on-premise server. More people start using
the website. Buy/rent new servers. Take time to set up. Cost a lot of
money.

Hosting a website using a cloud server. Access to computing power
instantly when you need it. More people start using the website, easily
release redundant cloud servers. Pay-as-you go service.

Cloud - Scalable, fast set-up speed, Pay-as-you-go.

On-premise - Less scalable, takes to set up, ongoing costs.

\hypertarget{other-uses-of-cloud-computing}{%
\paragraph{Other uses of cloud
computing}\label{other-uses-of-cloud-computing}}

Store, back up and recover data. Create cloud-native applications.
Stream audio and video. Deliver software on demand. Analyze data.

\hypertarget{cloud-services}{%
\paragraph{Cloud services}\label{cloud-services}}

three top technology services on the Cloud. compute, storage, databases.
Compute, provide the brains to process your workload. Storage: save and
store the data. Databases: store more structured sets of data.

\hypertarget{virtualization}{%
\subparagraph{Virtualization}\label{virtualization}}

Physical server: multiple virtual servers. Maximizes the output of
individual servers. Economies of scale.

\hypertarget{scalability}{%
\subparagraph{Scalability}\label{scalability}}

Handling traffic. Vertical scaling: Increase the power of the instance.
Horizontal scaling: Add ore instances.

\hypertarget{cost}{%
\subparagraph{Cost}\label{cost}}

Only pay for resources when you are using them. No capital expenses of:
buying hardware and software, managing on-site infrastructure. In some
cases, an on-premise solution might be more cost-efficient. The best
solution depends on the use case.

\hypertarget{speed}{%
\subparagraph{Speed}\label{speed}}

Immediate access to ready-to-go cloud services.

\hypertarget{performance}{%
\subparagraph{Performance}\label{performance}}

Access to fast and efficient computing resources. Data center: houses an
organization's IT operations and equipment.

Cloud gives access to worldwide network of data centers, fast and
efficient computing hardware.

\hypertarget{growth}{%
\subparagraph{Growth}\label{growth}}

Grow using a wide range of resources and services

\hypertarget{reliability}{%
\subparagraph{Reliability}\label{reliability}}

Guaranteed durability and availability of data and services.

\hypertarget{security}{%
\subparagraph{Security}\label{security}}

Secure storage and management of your data. External party responsible
for security. Particularly risky for business in highly regulated
sectors. Cloud is becoming more and more secure.

\hypertarget{cloud-service-models}{%
\paragraph{Cloud service models}\label{cloud-service-models}}

On-premise: buying a car. Cloud: Renting a car. economies at scale.

On premise -- car owned.

Infrastructure as a service -- car rented.

Platform as a service -- ride sharing.

Software as a service -- public transport.

abstraction and control (the cloud pyramid). Function as a service,
variation of Saas. Anything as a service.

\hypertarget{chapter-2---cloud-deployment-model}{%
\subsubsection{Chapter 2 - Cloud deployment
model}\label{chapter-2---cloud-deployment-model}}

Important decision in cloud adoption. How much control do you need over
your cloud environment?

\hypertarget{private}{%
\paragraph{Private}\label{private}}

Cloud infra is designated for exclusive use by its tenants. Private
clouds are accessed by a network link.

Pros: Direct control of resources and data, e.g., operating systems.

Cons: More upfront investment.

Unlike on-premise, private cloud uses virtualization for on-demand
compute resources and can be off-premises.

\hypertarget{public}{%
\paragraph{Public}\label{public}}

Cloud infra is shared and open for use by the general public. It's owned
and managed by a cloud service provider. Public clouds are internet
accessible.

Pros: Get started quickly with minimal investment. Easier to scale.

Cons: No access to data center and hardware.

\hypertarget{hybrid}{%
\paragraph{Hybrid}\label{hybrid}}

Organization uses a combination of two or more distinct models.
Different models interact via links. Example: application on public,
customer data stored on private. when private cloud hits capacity,
temporarily move to the public cloud to avoid disruption of service.

\hypertarget{other-deployment-models}{%
\paragraph{Other deployment models}\label{other-deployment-models}}

Multicloud: combination of different cloud provider services.
Flexibility on pricingt plans and service offerings.

\hypertarget{community}{%
\paragraph{Community}\label{community}}

Infra shared by a specific community for exclusive use. Common interest
of concern, e.g., security, jurisdication, mission.

\hypertarget{regulations-on-the-cloud}{%
\paragraph{Regulations on the cloud}\label{regulations-on-the-cloud}}

Having servers around the globe can reduce the latency. The greater the
distance between two points, the longer it will take for data to get
there.

An example of data privacy law: General Data Protection Regulation
(GDPR), regulates how personal data is collected, processed, and stored
from users in the European Union.

Examples: Users must explicitly consent to data collection. Nofity users
of any data breaches. Personal data information must be encrypted,
anonymized, and/or pseudonymized. Personal data can't leave EU borders,
unless you can guarantee the same level of protection.

What is personal data? Any information that related to an identified of
identifiable living individual. Different pieces of information, which
collected together can lead to identification of a particular person.

Personally identifiable information (PII).

Other regulations.

\hypertarget{cloud-roles}{%
\paragraph{Cloud roles}\label{cloud-roles}}

Cloud adoption can reduce maintenance and operational costs, including
personnel. Cloud-related skills in job market. Cloud computing skills.
All Cloud providers have established certifications for roles.

Familiar data roles and the cloud -

\begin{itemize}
\item Data Scientist: Run computationally expensive analyses on the cloud.
\item Machine Learning Scientist: train and deploy ML models on the cloud.
\item Data engineer: Build pipelines on the cloud to ingest, transform, and store big data.
\item Data analyst: Access data on the cloud via business intelligence tools.
\end{itemize}

Creation of new roles -

\begin{itemize}
\item Cloud architect: Design cloud infra for a given business problem.
\item Cloud engineer: Build, maintain and monitor cloud services.
\item DevOps engineer: Software development and IT Operations. Ensure reliability, availability and scalability of the cloud through software development and automation.
\item Security engineer: Spec security requirements. 
\end{itemize}

Cloud competition is fierce. SaaS tells a different story. Best provider
is the one meeting your needs. Cost of running a data center, physical
hardware, storage; cost of applications; costs of hiring; benefits.

Future of the cloud: Growing amount of data. AI needs computing
resources. Smart cities need an underlying infrastructure. Serverless
architectures are more and more popular.
